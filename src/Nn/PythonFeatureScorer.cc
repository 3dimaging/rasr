/*
 * PythonFeatureScorer uses a Python interface to get the scores.
 * The scores will we forwarded as-is. Negative log scores are expected, i.e. something like -log p(x|s).
 * So if you have a NN with posteriors, you need to divide by the prior on the Python side.
 *
 * For an RNN, esp a bidirectional one, we need to first get all the features before we can
 * forward it and get the scores. That is important for the design of this class.
 *
 * Also, this class supports buffering (isBuffered() == true), so both the
 * addFeature()/flush() but also the (traditionally non-buffered) getScorer()
 * has to be supported.
 * getScorer() is used e.g. in the aligner.
 * addFeature()/flush() is used by the recognizer.
 *
 * Python interface:
 *
 * PythonControl is used. See its documentation. In short:
 * init(sprint_unit='PythonFeatureScorer', ...) from the Python module will get called and is expected to return some object.
 * Member functions of this object will get called for the further communication.
 *
 * Member functions which will get called:
 *
 *   init(input_dim: int, output_dim: int)  # output-dim is the number of emission classes for us
 *   get_feature_buffer_size()  # expected to return -1 for now
 *   add_feature(feature: numpy.ndarray, time: int)  # feature is of shape (input_dim,)
 *   reset(num_frames: int)  # signals that we can flush any buffers
 *   compute(num_frames: int)  # all the features which we received so far should be evaluated
 *   get_scores(time: int)  # expected to return a numpy.ndarray of shape (output_dim,)
 *
